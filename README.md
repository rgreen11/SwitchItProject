# SwitchItProject
SwitchIt is a virtual closet app used to help our users organize their wardrobes, with a simply click of a button. Users have the ability to upload images of their items to their closets, plan outfits in advance with our calendar feature, and help users decide what to wear on the fly with our random outfit generator feature.
